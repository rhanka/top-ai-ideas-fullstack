# Feature: BR-14b Chat Service Core

## Objective
Modularize the chat-service core above the mesh-backed model runtime so reasoning loops, tool loops, continuation, cancellation, retry, checkpoints, and trace/audit boundaries become explicit and testable.
The branch must preserve current chat API, streaming, local-tool handoff, tool-result continuation, cancellation, retry, checkpoint, and error behavior.

## Scope / Guardrails
- Scope limited to API chat-service orchestration above model access.
- Current package reality is `@sentropic/llm-mesh`; older orchestration documents may still mention `@entropic/llm-mesh` and must be interpreted as the historical name unless BR-14e updates naming globally.
- BR-14b must not define provider/model access, provider adapters, model catalogs, credential resolution, or dispatch migration.
- All model access must remain delegated to `@sentropic/llm-mesh` through the existing mesh-backed runtime boundary.
- BR-14a may scope in parallel, but BR-14a implementation must wait for BR-14b boundaries to stabilize.
- Make-only workflow, no direct Docker or npm commands.
- Branch development happens in isolated worktree `tmp/refacto-chat-service-core`.
- Automated tests must run on dedicated environments, never on root `ENV=dev`.
- In every `make` command, `ENV=<env>` must be passed as the last argument.
- All code, comments, commits, PR title/body, and Markdown are English.
- No merge is allowed with CI-only evidence. Final merge requires explicit user UAT passed, or explicit user UAT waiver with reason recorded in this file.

## Branch Scope Boundaries (MANDATORY)
- **Allowed Paths (implementation scope)**:
  - `BRANCH.md`
  - `spec/**`
  - `api/src/services/chat-service.ts`
  - `api/src/services/chat/**`
  - `api/src/services/tools.ts`
  - `api/src/services/stream-service.ts`
  - `api/src/services/llm-runtime/**` only for import-boundary adjustments that preserve mesh ownership
  - `api/src/routes/chat*.ts`
  - `api/src/routes/**/chat*.ts`
  - `api/tests/**/chat*.test.ts`
  - `api/tests/**/chat*.spec.ts`
  - `api/tests/**/live-ai*.test.ts`
  - `api/tests/**/tools*.test.ts`
  - `api/tests/**/stream*.test.ts`
  - `api/tests/**/fixtures/**`
- **Forbidden Paths (must not change in this branch)**:
  - `Makefile`
  - `docker-compose*.yml`
  - `.cursor/rules/**`
  - `.github/workflows/**`
  - `packages/llm-mesh/**`
  - `packages/**/package.json`
  - `api/drizzle/**`
  - `ui/**`
  - `e2e/**`
  - `plan/14a-BRANCH_feat-chat-ui-sdk.md`
  - `plan/14b-BRANCH_refacto-chat-service-core.md`
- **Conditional Paths (allowed only with explicit exception when not already listed in Allowed Paths)**:
  - `README.md`
  - `README.fr.md`
  - `PLAN.md`
  - `TODO.md`
  - `spec/SPEC_EVOL_ENTROPIC_BR14_ORCHESTRATION.md`
  - `spec/SPEC_EVOL_LLM_MESH.md`
  - `spec/SPEC_CHATBOT.md`
- **Exception process**:
  - Declare exception ID `BR14b-EXn` in `## Feedback Loop` before touching any conditional or forbidden path.
  - Include reason, impact, and rollback strategy.
  - Mirror the same exception in this file under `## Feedback Loop`.

## Feedback Loop
- `attention` 2026-05-12: BR14g was merged without an explicit UAT checkpoint. BR14b final gate therefore requires recorded user UAT passed or explicit user UAT waiver before merge; CI alone is insufficient.
- `attention` 2026-05-12: Historical docs still reference `@entropic/llm-mesh`, but the published package is `@sentropic/llm-mesh`. BR14b must use the current code/package reality and leave global naming cleanup to BR14e unless a local reference blocks implementation.
- `deferred` 2026-05-12: BR14a implementation is deferred until BR14b stabilizes chat-service core boundaries. BR14a Lot 0 scoping may proceed in parallel.

## AI Flaky tests
- Acceptance rule:
  - Accept only non-systematic provider/network/model nondeterminism as `flaky accepted`.
  - Non-systematic means at least one success on the same commit and same command.
  - Never amend tests with additive timeouts.
  - If flaky, analyze impact vs `main`: if unrelated, accept and record command + failing test file + signature in `BRANCH.md`; if related, treat as blocking.
  - Capture explicit user sign-off before merge.
- BR14b policy:
  - Do not create a dedicated flaky branch from BR14b.
  - If AI nondeterminism appears, document it as evidence only and continue only with user sign-off.

## Orchestration Mode (AI-selected)
- [x] **Mono-branch + sidecar scoping**
- [ ] **Multi-branch**
- Rationale: BR14b implementation should stay in one branch because chat-service boundaries are tightly coupled. BR14a may run in parallel as scoping only, with no implementation and no shared writes.

## Environment Mapping
- Development env: `refacto-chat-service-core`
- API port: `9071`
- UI port: `5271`
- MailDev UI port: `1171`
- API test env: `test-refacto-chat-service-core`
- E2E env: `e2e-refacto-chat-service-core`
- Command style: `make <target> API_PORT=9071 UI_PORT=5271 MAILDEV_UI_PORT=1171 ENV=<env>` with `ENV` last.

## UAT Management (in orchestration context)
- UAT is mandatory before merge unless the user explicitly waives it in writing.
- UAT qualification branch/worktree must be commit-identical to the branch under qualification.
- UAT must focus on chat behavior: streaming response, local tool handoff, tool-result continuation, cancellation, retry, checkpoint visibility, and error display.
- Final gate step 3 is forbidden until `UAT passed` or `UAT waived by user` is recorded in this file.

## Plan / Todo (lot-based)
- [ ] **Lot 0 — Baseline, inventory, and constraints**
  - [x] Create isolated worktree `tmp/refacto-chat-service-core` from `origin/main`.
  - [x] Confirm branch starts after BR14c, BR14g, and BR24 merges.
  - [x] Record current naming reality: `@sentropic/llm-mesh` is the published/current package name.
  - [x] Capture initial file sizes: `chat-service.ts` 5671 lines, `tools.ts` 1428 lines, `stream-service.ts` 295 lines.
  - [x] Identify primary test surfaces: `api/tests/ai/chat-sync.test.ts`, `api/tests/ai/comment-assistant.test.ts`, `api/tests/api/chat-message-actions.test.ts`, `api/tests/api/chat-history-analyze-tool.test.ts`, `api/tests/api/chat-checkpoint-contract.test.ts`, `api/tests/api/queue-stream-bootstrap-contract.test.ts`, stream/tool-related unit tests.
  - [ ] Read `api/src/services/chat-service.ts` once and identify responsibilities currently mixed in the file.

  - [ ] Delete `spec/BRANCH_SPEC_EVOL.md` after integration if it was created.
  - [ ] Keep global naming cleanup deferred to BR14e unless a local inconsistency blocks BR14b.

- [ ] **Lot N — Final validation and merge gate**
  - [ ] Typecheck and lint API.
  - [ ] Retest impacted API chat/tool/stream/live-AI files identified in Lot 0.
  - [ ] Verify PR CI is green.
  - [ ] Verify `UAT passed` or `UAT waived by user` is recorded in this file.
  - [ ] Final gate step 1: create/update PR using `BRANCH.md` text as PR body.
  - [ ] Final gate step 2: resolve CI and UAT blockers.
  - [ ] Final gate step 3: only after CI + UAT/waiver are both OK, commit removal of `BRANCH.md`, push, and merge.
