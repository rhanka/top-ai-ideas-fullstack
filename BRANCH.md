# Feature: TODO + Steering + Workflow Core

## Objective
Rebuild BR-03 from baseline `3f889e3` to deliver TODO/plan + steering + workflow core semantics from `spec/SPEC_EVOL_AGENTIC_WORKSPACE_TODO.md`: executable domain model, runtime orchestration, in-flight steer, and minimal UI surfaces (chat TODO card + basic agent/workflow configuration).

## Scope / Guardrails
- Scope limited to BR-03 v1 semantics:
  - task/todo/plan runtime entities and transitions;
  - guardrails and ownership/assignment rules;
  - execution runs/events with in-flight `steer`;
  - workflow and agent configuration v1 (fork/detach/inheritance metadata);
  - minimal UI only: in-chat TODO rendering/creation + basic settings sections.
- Explicitly out of scope in BR-03:
  - full Plan/Comments/Chat/Jobs operational panel (deferred to BR-14);
  - broad panel redesign and workflow studio/designer UX;
  - broader workspace template catalog/multi-template management (BR-04/BR-05).
- One migration max in `api/drizzle/*.sql` (if applicable).
- Make-only workflow, no direct Docker commands.
- Root workspace `~/src/top-ai-ideas-fullstack` is reserved for user dev/UAT (`ENV=dev`) and must remain stable.
- Branch development must happen in isolated worktree `tmp/feat-<slug>` (even for one active branch).
- Automated test campaigns must run on dedicated environments (`ENV=test-*` / `ENV=e2e-*`), never on root `dev`.
- UAT qualification branch/worktree must be commit-identical to the branch under qualification (same HEAD SHA; no extra commits before sign-off). If subtree/sync is used, record source and target SHAs in `BRANCH.md`.
- In every `make` command, `ENV=<env>` must be passed as the last argument.
- Environment mapping for this branch:
  - Dev runtime: `ENV=dev-feat-todo-steering-workflow-core`
  - Test runtime: `ENV=test-feat-todo-steering-workflow-core`
  - E2E runtime: `ENV=e2e-feat-todo-steering-workflow-core`
  - Ports: `API_PORT=8703`, `UI_PORT=5103`, `MAILDEV_UI_PORT=1003`
- No timeout inflation in tests:
  - do not increase `test.setTimeout(...)` values in E2E/API tests;
  - stabilize with deterministic fixtures/polling and scoped retries only.
- Dependencies and assumptions (explicit):
  - Upstream dependency: BR-00 (`done`) is required baseline.
  - Upstream dependency used by BR-03: BR-01 model/provider runtime contracts (`done`) for agent assignment defaults in config surfaces.
  - Downstream consumers: BR-04 (template catalog) and BR-05 (VSCode plugin v1) consume BR-03 APIs/contracts.
  - Assumption: task status set stays `todo | planned | in_progress | blocked | done | deferred | cancelled` unless `Feedback Loop` overrides.
  - Assumption: permission model is workspace-scoped and extends existing RBAC/workspace membership mechanisms.
- All new text in English.

## Branch Scope Boundaries (MANDATORY)
- **Allowed Paths (implementation scope)**:
  - `api/**`
  - `ui/**`
  - `e2e/**`
  - `BRANCH.md`
  - `plan/03-BRANCH_feat-todo-steering-workflow-core.md`
- **Forbidden Paths (must not change in this branch)**:
  - `Makefile`
  - `docker-compose*.yml`
  - `.cursor/rules/**`
  - `plan/NN-BRANCH_*.md` (except this branch file)
- **Conditional Paths (allowed only with explicit exception when not already listed in Allowed Paths)**:
  - `api/drizzle/*.sql` (max 1 file)
  - `.github/workflows/**`
  - `spec/**`, `PLAN.md`, `TODO.md` (docs consolidation or roadmap sync only)
  - `scripts/**` (only if strictly required by the branch objective)
- **Exception process**:
  - Declare exception ID `BRxx-EXn` in `## Feedback Loop` before touching any conditional/forbidden path.
  - Include reason, impact, and rollback strategy.
  - Mirror the same exception in this file under `## Feedback Loop`.

## Feedback Loop
Actions with the following status should be included around tasks only if really required (cf. Task 1 feedback loop):
- subagent or agent requires support or informs: `blocked` / `deferred` / `cancelled` / `attention`
- conductor agent or human brings response: `clarification` / `acknowledge` / `refuse`

  - `Owner`: sub-agent implementation run + conductor
  - `Severity`: medium
  - `Status`: `acknowledge`
  - `Repro steps`:
    - run `make typecheck-api ENV=test-feat-todo-steering-workflow-core`
    - run `make lint-api ENV=test-feat-todo-steering-workflow-core`
    - run `make test-api-unit ENV=test-feat-todo-steering-workflow-core`
  - `Expected`: branch test environment health checks and broad API gates run without schema drift errors.
  - `Actual`: drift reproduced on `2026-02-26` (`drizzle.__drizzle_migrations` already at ids 23/24 while `settings` missed `user_id`), causing API health 503 and unit failures.
  - `Evidence`: `make logs-api ENV=test-feat-todo-steering-workflow-core`, `make exec-api CMD="...information_schema.columns..." ENV=test-feat-todo-steering-workflow-core`, then successful reruns of `make typecheck-api ENV=test-feat-todo-steering-workflow-core`, `make lint-api ENV=test-feat-todo-steering-workflow-core`, `make test-api-unit ENV=test-feat-todo-steering-workflow-core`.
  - `Resolution`: add idempotent schema reconciliation in `api/src/db/run-migrations.ts` (drop legacy `settings_pkey`, ensure `settings.user_id` + FK + unique indexes) after drizzle migrate.
  - `Blocker threshold`: closed.
- `ID`: `BR03-FL06`
  - `Branch`: `BR-03`
  - `Owner`: sub-agent implementation run + conductor
  - `Severity`: medium
  - `Status`: `deferred`
  - `Repro steps`:
    - run `make test-e2e E2E_SPEC=tests/03-chat.spec.ts API_PORT=8703 UI_PORT=5103 MAILDEV_UI_PORT=1003 REGISTRY=local ENV=e2e-feat-todo-steering-workflow-core`
  - `Expected`: `tests/03-chat.spec.ts` reaches chat surface and finds page heading `h1` containing `Dossiers`.
  - `Actual`: test failed on `tests/03-chat.spec.ts:97` with retries (`retry #1`, `retry #2`): `expect(locator('h1')).toContainText('Dossiers')` => `element(s) not found`; UI logs show repeated `[404] GET /entreprises`.
  - `Evidence`: A12 command output (`tests/03-chat.spec.ts expected h1 'Dossiers' not found`) + `make logs-ui API_PORT=8703 UI_PORT=5103 MAILDEV_UI_PORT=1003 ENV=e2e-feat-todo-steering-workflow-core` signature `[404] GET /entreprises`.
  - `Product-vs-test conclusion`: `test bug` candidate (route expectation mismatch at UI entrypoint) rather than BR-03 product runtime regression; API logs show healthy/auth traffic without correlated backend fault.
  - `Decision needed`: confirm canonical route/heading contract for chat E2E (`/entreprises` + `Dossiers`) before reopening Lot3 E2E gate.
  - `Blocker threshold`: non-blocking for current Lot2 closure; blocking for Lot3 E2E completion.
- `ID`: `BR03-FL07`
  - `Branch`: `BR-03`
  - `Owner`: sub-agent implementation run + conductor
  - `Severity`: medium
  - `Status`: `deferred`
  - `Repro steps`:
    - run `make test-e2e E2E_SPEC=tests/06-settings.spec.ts API_PORT=8703 UI_PORT=5103 MAILDEV_UI_PORT=1003 REGISTRY=local ENV=e2e-feat-todo-steering-workflow-core`
  - `Expected`: settings page and workspace table are visible for scoped settings E2E.
  - `Actual`: scoped run reported `2 flaky`, `3 skipped`, `14 passed` with signatures:
    - `tests/06-settings.spec.ts:53` => `expect(locator('h1')).toContainText('Paramètres')` failed (`element(s) not found`).
    - `tests/06-settings.spec.ts:273` => `expect(rowAlpha).toBeVisible()` failed (`element(s) not found` for `locator('tbody tr').filter({ has: locator('.editable-input') }).first()`).
  - `Evidence`: A14 command output for `tests/06-settings.spec.ts` (retry attempts shown in output; failing signatures captured above).
  - `Product-vs-test conclusion`: `test bug` candidate (UI selector/initial-render flakiness in E2E assertions) rather than BR-03 product regression.
  - `Decision needed`: stabilize/align settings E2E selectors and readiness expectations before accepting Lot3 E2E completion.
  - `Blocker threshold`: non-blocking for current Lot2 closure; blocking for Lot3 E2E completion.
- `ID`: `BR03-FL08`
  - `Branch`: `BR-03`
  - `Owner`: sub-agent implementation run + conductor
  - `Severity`: medium
  - `Status`: `deferred`
  - `Repro steps`:
    - run `make test-e2e E2E_SPEC=tests/07_comment_assistant.spec.ts API_PORT=8703 UI_PORT=5103 MAILDEV_UI_PORT=1003 REGISTRY=local ENV=e2e-feat-todo-steering-workflow-core`
  - `Expected`: scoped AI-flaky E2E `07_comment_assistant` completes with both scenarios passing.
  - `Actual`:
    - initial launch failed before spec execution: `Bind for 0.0.0.0:1003 failed: port is already allocated`.
    - after lane cleanup/rerun, test failed on retries with stable signature: `tests/07_comment_assistant.spec.ts:117:3 IA poste un commentaire + badge Assistant IA` (`3.0m`) and `retry #1` same signature (`3.0m`).
  - `Evidence`:
    - failing command output from scoped run above.
    - protocol captures on failing env: `make logs-api API_PORT=8703 UI_PORT=5103 MAILDEV_UI_PORT=1003 ENV=e2e-feat-todo-steering-workflow-core`, `make logs-ui API_PORT=8703 UI_PORT=5103 MAILDEV_UI_PORT=1003 ENV=e2e-feat-todo-steering-workflow-core`, `make db-query QUERY="SELECT 1;" API_PORT=8703 UI_PORT=5103 MAILDEV_UI_PORT=1003 ENV=e2e-feat-todo-steering-workflow-core` (same port-allocation signature).
    - diff context vs `origin/main`: `git diff --name-status origin/main...HEAD` shows BR-03 scope files only (`api/**`, migration, `BRANCH.md`, branch plan).
  - `Product-vs-test conclusion`: provisional `test/infra` (lane port collision) + `test bug/flaky` candidate on `07_comment_assistant:117`; no BR-03 product regression signature isolated yet.
  - `Decision needed`: stabilize `07_comment_assistant` deterministic readiness/assertion path and rerun scoped AI-flaky gate on clean lane.
  - `Blocker threshold`: non-blocking for BR-03 scoped progression; blocking for final AI-flaky completion.

## AI Flaky tests
- Acceptance rule:
  - Accept only non-systematic provider/network/model nondeterminism as `flaky accepted`.
  - Non-systematic means at least one success on the same commit and same command.
  - Never amend tests with additive timeouts.
  - If flaky, analyze impact vs `main`: if unrelated, accept and record command + failing test file + signature in `BRANCH.md`; if related, treat as blocking.
  - Capture explicit user sign-off before merge.

## Orchestration Mode (AI-selected)
- [x] **Mono-branch + cherry-pick** (default for orthogonal tasks; single final test cycle)
- [ ] **Multi-branch** (only if sub-workstreams require independent CI or long-running validation)
- Rationale: BR-03 is a single capability branch with tight API/UI coupling; one integrated validation cycle reduces contract drift before BR-04/BR-05 consume it.

## UAT Management (in orchestration context)
- **Mono-branch**: UAT is performed on the integrated branch only (after each lot, when UI changes exist).
- UAT checkpoints must be listed as checkboxes inside each relevant lot (no separate UAT section).
- Execution flow (mandatory):
  - Develop and run tests in `tmp/feat-<slug>`.
  - Push branch before UAT.
  - Run user UAT from root workspace (`~/src/top-ai-ideas-fullstack`, `ENV=dev`).
  - Switch back to `tmp/feat-<slug>` after UAT.

## Plan / Todo (lot-based)
- [x] **Lot 0 — Baseline & constraints refresh**
  - [x] Confirm branch baseline is `3f889e3` from `origin/main`.
  - [x] Re-read mandatory rule/spec/template set and freeze BR-03 boundaries from `spec/SPEC_EVOL_AGENTIC_WORKSPACE_TODO.md`.
  - [x] Confirm isolated worktree `tmp/feat-todo-steering-workflow-core`.
  - [x] Confirm environment mapping and command style:
    - `ENV=dev-feat-todo-steering-workflow-core` for branch dev runtime.
    - `ENV=test-feat-todo-steering-workflow-core` for API/UI test runs.
    - `ENV=e2e-feat-todo-steering-workflow-core` for Playwright runs.
    - `ENV` must always be the last argument in `make` commands.
  - [x] Confirm scope in/out split:
    - include TODO/plan + steering + workflow core semantics.
    - exclude broad panel redesign (deferred to BR-14).
  - [x] Freeze `Feedback Loop` clarifications (`BR03-FL01..FL04`) before implementation lots. (locked by conductor/product decisions on 2026-02-26)
  - [x] Validate scope boundaries (`Allowed/Forbidden/Conditional`) and keep `BR03-EX1` pending for docs consolidation.
  - [x] Prepare implementation file map and one-migration strategy:
    - target migration: `api/drizzle/0023_todo_steering_workflow_core.sql` (single file max).
    - schema updates in `api/src/db/schema.ts`.
    - domain services/tests map:
      - `api/src/services/todo-runtime.ts`
      - `api/tests/unit/task-status-machine.test.ts`
      - `api/tests/unit/todo-plan-ownership.test.ts`
      - `api/tests/unit/guardrail-enforcement.test.ts`
      - `api/tests/unit/workflow-placeholder-extraction.test.ts`

- [x] **Lot 1 — Data model + domain invariants (TODO/plan/task/guardrails/runs)**
  - [x] Add one consolidated migration for BR-03 core entities:
    - `plans`, `todos`, `tasks`
    - `todo_dependencies`, `task_dependencies` (optional task-level dependencies)
    - `task_io_contracts`
    - `guardrails`
    - `workflow_definitions`, `workflow_definition_tasks`
    - `agent_definitions`
    - `entity_links`
    - `execution_runs`, `execution_events` (including `steer` events)
  - [x] Extend `api/src/db/schema.ts` with typed table definitions + indexes + relations.
  - [x] Implement domain services for:
    - task status transition matrix validation;
    - ownership/reassignment rules;
    - guardrail enforcement classification (`scope`, `quality`, `safety`, `approval`);
    - run/event model write/read semantics.
  - [x] Keep TODO/plan aggregate status behavior aligned with `BR03-FL01` decision.
  - [x] Reconcile drifted settings schema at startup/migration time (`settings.user_id` remediation for `BR03-FL05`).
  - [x] Lot gate:
    - [x] `make typecheck-api ENV=test-feat-todo-steering-workflow-core`
    - [x] `make lint-api ENV=test-feat-todo-steering-workflow-core`
    - [x] **API tests**
      - [x] Existing files to update:

- [ ] **Lot 3 — Minimal UI surfaces (chat TODO + agent/workflow config)** (Implementation advanced; scoped UI/E2E gates remain open and must be executed after implementation completion.)
  - [x] Implement in-chat TODO rendering when AI creates/uses TODO (chat card/list surface only). (Implementation evidence 2026-02-26: `ui/src/lib/components/StreamMessage.svelte` now parses `tool_call_result` for `todo_create` and renders inline TODO cards with plan/todo/task summary in chat messages.)
  - [x] Implement chat-driven TODO creation flow using BR-03 APIs. (Implementation evidence 2026-02-26: `ui/src/lib/components/ChatPanel.svelte` now exposes `todo_create` tool toggle in chat tool orchestration using existing `/api/v1/chat/messages` flow.)
  - [x] Add basic `Agent Configuration` and `Workflow Configuration` sections in `/settings` with fork/detach/inheritance indicators. (Implementation evidence 2026-02-26: new `ui/src/lib/components/TodoRuntimeConfigPanel.svelte` integrated in `ui/src/routes/settings/+page.svelte`; supports list/edit/fork/detach and drift indicator based on parent sync timestamps.)
  - [x] Implement placeholder extraction behavior (`{{object_name}}`) into workflow metadata save/update flow. (Implementation evidence 2026-02-26: `TodoRuntimeConfigPanel` computes per-section placeholder tokens and persists `config.placeholderMetadata` on workflow save via `PUT /workflow-config`.)
  - [ ] Keep explicit BR-03 UX boundary: (Open blocker: boundary validation requires Lot3 UI implementation + targeted regression checks not yet run.)
    - no full Plan/Comments/Chat/Jobs operational panel;
    - no visual workflow designer.
  - [x] Add/update localized UI keys in:

    - `ui/src/locales/fr.json` (chat TODO tool/card labels + runtime settings section labels/errors/toasts)

- [ ] **Lot N-2 — UAT**
  - [ ] Web app
    - [ ] UAT setup:
      - [ ] Push branch from `tmp/feat-todo-steering-workflow-core`.
      - [ ] Switch to root workspace `~/src/top-ai-ideas-fullstack` with `ENV=dev`.
    - [ ] Detailed evol tests:
      - [ ] Open chat, ask AI to create a TODO with at least 3 tasks; verify inline TODO card renders in chat.
      - [ ] Verify TODO/task statuses follow v1 transitions (`todo -> planned -> in_progress -> done` and blocked/deferred/cancelled paths).
      - [ ] Reassign TODO owner and one task assignee; verify permission checks and audit/event trace.
      - [ ] Start a task, send steer message during execution, verify run event stream and status progression.
      - [ ] Trigger a guardrail requiring approval; verify transition is prevented until approval path is satisfied.
      - [ ] Open `/settings`, verify Agent Configuration and Workflow Configuration sections (list, edit, fork, detach, inheritance drift indicator).
    - [ ] Detailed non-regression tests:
      - [ ] Standard chat send/receive still works.
      - [ ] Existing settings sections (AI settings, prompts, workspace settings) still operate.
      - [ ] Workspace switching and RBAC behavior remain unchanged.
  - [ ] Chrome plugin
    - [ ] UAT setup:
      - [ ] Launch extension overlay/sidepanel against same backend instance.
    - [ ] Detailed evol tests:
      - [ ] In extension chat, trigger TODO creation and confirm inline TODO rendering parity with web app.
      - [ ] Validate steer-related chat behavior does not break extension session lifecycle.
    - [ ] Detailed non-regression tests:
      - [ ] Local tool permissions menu remains functional.
      - [ ] Existing chat context scoping behavior remains stable.
  - [ ] VSCode plugin
    - [ ] UAT setup:
      - [ ] BR-05 plugin surface not delivered yet; run contract validation only.
    - [ ] Detailed evol tests:
      - [ ] Validate BR-03 endpoint contracts manually (plans/todos/tasks/runs/agent-config/workflow-config) for BR-05 handoff payload compatibility.
    - [ ] Detailed non-regression tests:
      - [ ] N/A for UI runtime until BR-05 implementation; keep as downstream dependency checkpoint.

- [ ] **Lot N-1 — Docs consolidation**
  - [ ] Apply `BR03-EX1` if docs paths are touched.
  - [ ] Consolidate BR-03 semantics into target specs:
    - `spec/SPEC_EVOL_AGENTIC_WORKSPACE_TODO.md` (close v1 deltas and freeze terminology/transitions).
    - cross-reference `PLAN.md` and `TODO.md` branch status/dependency notes.
  - [ ] Explicitly retain BR-14 deferral for broad panel redesign.
  - [ ] If `spec/BRANCH_SPEC_EVOL.md` was used during implementation, fold it into canonical specs and delete it.
