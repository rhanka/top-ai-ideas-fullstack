# Conductor Questions

## BR-00 `feat/roadmap-stabilization`

1. **BR00-Q1** (priority: high)  
No active git conflicts remain. What is the canonical Lot 1 parity policy: strict `main` runtime parity first, or selective arbitration per impacted area with explicit rationale?

2. **BR00-Q2** (priority: high)  
For `CVE-2026-26996_api_minimatch_10.1.2`, must BR-00 deliver an actual fix, or only a planned mitigation? If mitigation only, provide owner, target branch, and exact due date (current `review_due` is 2026-02-26).

3. **BR00-Q3** (priority: medium)  
What is the minimum CI/UAT scope required to unblock W1 for BR-00 sign-off (full extension + web parity matrix vs reduced smoke scope)?

4. **BR00-Q4** (priority: high)  
Please provide final answers for QL-1 blockers before W1 launch: `MPA-Q1`, `MPA-Q2`, `MPA-Q3`, `AWT-Q1`, `AWT-Q2`, `AWT-Q5`.

5. **BR00-Q5** (resolved)  
Resolved on 2026-02-22: owner is conductor (Codex) and `tmp/feat-roadmap-stabilization` is created/configured.
