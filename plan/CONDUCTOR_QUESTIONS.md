## BR-00 `feat/roadmap-stabilization`

1. **BR00-Q1** (priority: high)  
What is the canonical conflict resolution policy for the 8 Lot 1 files: strict `main` parity first, or per-file arbitration between `main` and `feat/minor-evols-ui`?

2. **BR00-Q2** (priority: high)  
For `CVE-2026-26996_api_minimatch_10.1.2`, must BR-00 deliver an actual fix, or only a planned mitigation? If mitigation only, provide owner, target branch, and exact due date (current `review_due` is 2026-02-26).

3. **BR00-Q3** (priority: medium)  
What is the minimum CI/UAT scope required to unblock W1 for BR-00 sign-off (full extension + web parity matrix vs reduced smoke scope)?

4. **BR00-Q4** (priority: high)  
Please provide final answers for QL-1 blockers before W1 launch: `MPA-Q1`, `MPA-Q2`, `MPA-Q3`, `AWT-Q1`, `AWT-Q2`, `AWT-Q5`.

5. **BR00-Q5** (priority: medium)  
Who is the owner to create and maintain `tmp/feat-roadmap-stabilization` as the isolated implementation worktree for BR-00 kickoff?
