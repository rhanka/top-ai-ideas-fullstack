# WORKFLOW

## Principles
- **FIRST**: Read `.cursor/rules/MASTER.mdc` for consolidated rules overview
- **SECOND**: Read `README.md` for project overview and setup
- **THIRD**: Read `TODO.md` for current priorities and items
- **FOURTH**: Read `RELEASE.md` for target version and scope
- Propose a short action plan before coding. Request human approval when "⚠ approval".
- apply `workflow.mdc` for coding practice and `testing.mdc` for testing practice and `security.mdc`for security
- be conform to `architecture.mdc` architecture directives


## FEATURE
1. Read the target `TODO.md` item (**Next** or **Now**).
2. **Create feature branch** with `BRANCH.md` documenting plan and tasks, asking relevant question before to start
3. Post a 3–6 step plan as the first PR comment.
4. Implement with guardrails (preview, dry-run, logs).
5. **Test before commit** - ensure all changes work as expected.
6. Update `TODO.md` (check item, reference PR) and `RELEASE.md` (scope).

As a very first thing, you acknowledge the next TODO and the way you will work on it following above workflow feature. If a BRANCH is in progress you also acknowledge where you are and check the state of the code to go on.

## Guardrails
- Never perform destructive DB/system actions without "⚠ approval".
- For Playwright/Cursor, always **simulate** before executing a critical action.
- **Always test before commit** - no exceptions to this rule.
- **Use Make for testing** - always run `make test.unit` before commit (see `testing.mdc`)

## Development Conventions
- **Commits**: Conventional Commits (feat:, fix:, chore:, refactor:, docs:, test:)
- **Branches**: `feat/<slug>`, `fix/<slug>`, `boot/<slug>`. Open only one at once
- **PR**: one capability per PR; checklist; clear description (objective + short plan)
- **Never proceed more than one item of `TODO.md`**
- **Be minimalist in changes** (don't refacto the whole to avoid regressions)
- **Commit messages and PR descriptions MUST be in English**
- **Use make targets** : `make up` for dev mode (and `make down`), `make logs` for logs. Don't reinvent 

## Commit Guidelines
- **Atomic commits** : One logical change per commit
- **File count limit** : Maximum 10-15 files per commit
- **Commit frequency** : Commit every 2-3 logical changes
- **Before major work** : Commit current progress
- **Commit message format** : `type: concise description`

### Commit Workflow (MANDATORY)
1. **Check status first** : Always run `git status` before committing
2. **Selective staging** : Use `git add <specific-files>` for files you know you modified or deleted, Never use `git add .` or `git add -A` (run `git status` before and after)
4. **Commit with context** : Include clear description of what changed and why
5. **ONE task per commit** : Complete ONE logical task, then commit. Do NOT chain multiple tasks without committing.
6. **Update current work**: update BRANCH.md and commit it to be sure of remaining work at every step
7. **Consolidate CI debug commits (MANDATORY)**: When experimenting with CI workflows (e.g., tweaking `.github/workflows/*.yml`), avoid piling multiple commit and use `git commit --amend --no-edit` (or edit message as needed). After amending or soft reset (history rewrite), you MUST push with `git push origin <branchname> --force` to update the remote safely.

### Next Step Proposal (MANDATORY)
After completing any task, **ALWAYS propose the next step** by following the workflow:
1. **Check current status** : What was just completed
2. **Identify next priority** : What comes next according to TODO.md or current context
3. **Propose specific action** : Clear, actionable next step
4. **Wait for approval** : Do not proceed without user confirmation

### Feature Completion Workflow (MANDATORY)
After implementing all commits for a feature:
1. **Push to GitHub** : `git push origin <branch-name>`
2. **Tech Debt**: if any component was updated, please ensure `components.mdc` was applied and update tech debt files.
2. **Final security validation** : Execute comprehensive security validation (see `security.mdc` for detailed workflow)
3. **Verify CI** : Push and Monitor GitHub Actions(using `curl` or `gh` for detailed logs) 
4. **Plan remaining actions** : If commits need additional substantial work, document in BRANCH.md - else commit --amend and git push --force <branch> until CI success
5. **Final cleanup** : When everything works:
   - Remove BRANCH.md
   - Check off feature in TODO.md
   - Update RELEASE.md
   - Create final commit with BRANCH.md content in commit message
   - Push final state
   - Create a PR if not existing and update PR message with last BRANCH.md content

### CI Monitoring (MANDATORY)
- After any push to a feature branch or PR update, automatically verify GitHub Actions runs.
- **Primary method**: use GitHub API via curl for basic status checks. Minimal, non-interactive checks:
  - Latest run for current branch:
    - `curl -s "https://api.github.com/repos/<ORG>/<REPO>/actions/runs?branch=$BRANCH&per_page=1" | grep -E '"event"|"status"|"conclusion"'`
  - Job list for a specific run id:
    - `curl -s "https://api.github.com/repos/<ORG>/<REPO>/actions/runs/<RUN_ID>/jobs" | grep -E '"name"|"conclusion"'`
- **Secondary method**: When curl is insufficient (e.g., accessing detailed logs, artifacts, or when API rate limits are hit), use `gh` CLI:
  - Install: `sudo apt install gh` or `sudo snap install gh`
  - Authenticate: `gh auth login` (requires GitHub token with `repo` and `workflow` scopes)
  - Access logs: `gh run view <RUN_ID> --log-failed` or `gh run view <RUN_ID> --log`
  - Download artifacts: `gh run download <RUN_ID>`
- If status is "skipped" unexpectedly, inspect workflow conditions/filters; for path-based workflows, ensure common files (Makefile, docker-compose.yml, packages/config, packages/schemas, CI files) are included in filters.
- If quick tweaks are needed, prefer `git commit --amend --no-edit` and push with `git push --force-with-lease`.
- If multiple debug commits were created, consolidate with `git reset --soft HEAD~N`, commit once, then `git push --force-with-lease`.
- **Push command**: Always use `git push origin <branch-name>` explicitly, never `git push --set-upstream`.

## Quality Gates
- **Before commit**: Run `make test-api` and/or `make test-ui` given you're changing api ou ui (enforced by testing.mdc)
- **Before PR**: Run `make build-api build-ui-image test-e2e` to validate consistency
- **CI/CD**: All tests must pass, guides must be consistent
- **Architecture**: Verify `make` commands work before any changes

## Dependency Management
- **Package-lock updates**: Always use `make update.<package>.lock` to update package-lock.json files (if implemented)
- **Docker-only**: Never run `npm install` directly - all dependency management must go through Docker
- **Available commands**: 
  - `make update.api.lock` - Update API package-lock.json (if implemented)
  - `make update.ui.lock` - Update UI package-lock.json (if implemented)
- **Clean environment**: Remove local `node_modules` if they exist outside Docker containers

## Tech-Debt Management

### Component Lifecycle Integration
- **MANDATORY**: Avoid updating components not directly related to current development (e.g don't change os and language version unless upgrade required but propose it before acting)
- **MANDATORY**: Update tech-debt files when updating components during development
- **Scope**: All component upgrades (npm, Docker images, OS versions)
- **Location**: `.components/tech-debt-<service>.md` files
- **Integration**: Tech-debt updates must be part of component upgrade workflow

### Tech-Debt Update Workflow
1. **Before upgrade**: Check current tech-debt status with `make audit-<service> COMPONENT=<component>` (e.g., `make audit-api COMPONENT=hono`) or `.components/tech-debt-<service>.md`
2. **During upgrade**: Update component version in package.json/Dockerfile
3. **After upgrade**: Update tech-debt file with new current version and re-audit
4. **Validation**: Run tests to ensure upgrade doesn't break functionality
5. **Documentation**: Update tech-debt file with new breaking change assessment

### Tech-Debt Update Commands
- **Audit current state**: Use `make audit-<service> COMPONENT=<component>` (e.g., `make audit-api COMPONENT=npm`) or check `.components/tech-debt-<service>.md` files
- **Check latest versions**: Manual review or use npm/pip commands in Docker containers
- **Update tech-debt**: Manually update `.components/tech-debt-<service>.md` files
- **Verify upgrade**: Run service tests after component upgrade

### Breaking Change Assessment
- **Major version upgrades**: Always assess for breaking changes before upgrading
- **Documentation required**: Update breaking change section in tech-debt files
- **Testing mandatory**: Run full test suite after major version upgrades
- **Rollback plan**: Document rollback strategy for major upgrades

### Quality Gates for Tech-Debt Updates
- **Before commit**: Tech-debt files must reflect current component versions
- **After upgrade**: Breaking change assessment must be updated
- **Test validation**: All tests must pass after component upgrade
- **Documentation sync**: Tech-debt files must match actual component versions

## Vulnerability Management Lifecycle

### Vulnerability Register Maintenance
- **Documentation mandatory**: All HIGH/CRITICAL/ERROR findings must be documented in `.security/vulnerability-register.yaml`
- **Categories required**: Each vulnerability must have a valid category (false_positive, accepted_risk, planned_mitigation, technical_debt)
- **Justification mandatory**: Every vulnerability must include justification for acceptance or deferral
- **Timeline required**: Fix goals must be specified (1d, 1w, 1m, 1y)

### Vulnerability Lifecycle Stages
1. **Discovery**: Found by security scans (SAST, SCA, Container, IaC)
2. **Assessment**: Categorized and risk-assessed
3. **Documentation**: Added to vulnerability register with justification
4. **Mitigation**: Fixed or accepted with timeline
5. **Verification**: Re-scanned to confirm resolution
6. **Cleanup**: Removed from register after successful mitigation

### Post-Mitigation Cleanup
- **Remove resolved vulnerabilities**: After successful fix, remove entry from vulnerability register
- **Update metadata**: Update `last_updated` timestamp in register metadata
- **Document resolution**: Add resolution details to commit message or documentation
- **Verify compliance**: Ensure all security scans pass after cleanup

### Register Maintenance Rules
- **Regular review**: Review vulnerability register monthly for outdated entries
- **Timeline validation**: Check if fix goals are realistic and achievable
- **Risk reassessment**: Periodically reassess risk levels of accepted vulnerabilities
- **Documentation updates**: Keep justifications and timelines current

### Integration with Component Lifecycle
- **Component upgrades**: When updating components, check if vulnerabilities are resolved
- **Security scans**: Run security scans after component upgrades to verify fixes
- **Tech-debt sync**: Update tech-debt files when vulnerabilities are resolved via component upgrades
- **Documentation**: Link vulnerability fixes to component upgrade commits

## Feature Branch Management

### Branch Documentation
- **REQUIRED**: Create `BRANCH.md` and a branch for each feature branch, defining scope (api, ui, ci) and limit work to avoid border effect (dont change Makefile or ci or tests if not required, or specify what should be minimally changed). The final two steps should be always test strategy completion from `testing.mdc` and Github CI execution check
- **LOCATION**: Root of feature branch (not committed to main)
- **PURPOSE**: Track progress, plan, and commit mapping

### BRANCH.md Structure
```markdown
