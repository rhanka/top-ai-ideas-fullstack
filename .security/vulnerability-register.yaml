    # Hono JWT Auth Middleware - Missing aud (Audience) verification
    CVE-2025-62610_api_hono_4.9.10:
      category: planned_mitigation
      risk: HIGH
      description: Hono JWT Auth Middleware does not provide built-in aud (Audience) verification option, which can cause confused-deputy / token-mix-up issues when multiple services share the same issuer/keys
      file: api/package.json
      line: 1
      cwe: CWE-285
      owasp: A01:2021
      fix_goal: 1w
      justification: |
        The vulnerability affects JWT authentication middleware in Hono framework.
        Current version: 4.9.10
        Fixed version: 4.10.2
        Risk: HIGH - Can lead to unintended cross-service access if multiple services share issuer/keys
        Mitigation: Update Hono to 4.10.2+ which includes aud verification support
        Impact: Low in current deployment (single API service, no shared JWT issuer), but should be fixed to prevent future issues
      status: open
      discovered: 2025-11-06
      planned_fix_date: 2025-11-13
