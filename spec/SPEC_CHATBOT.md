## Model runtime baseline (5 providers) — delivered (BR-01 + BR-08)

- Runtime model catalog is exposed by `GET /api/v1/models/catalog` and consumed by grouped selectors in:
  - chat composer,
  - user settings (`/settings`),
  - folder generation (`/folder/new`).
- User-level defaults are managed by:
  - `GET /api/v1/me/ai-settings`,
  - `PUT /api/v1/me/ai-settings`.
- Storage strategy (delivered):
  - existing `settings` table extended with nullable `user_id` (FK `users.id`) for scoped KV entries,
  - admin/global settings remain in rows with `user_id IS NULL`,
  - user defaults are persisted with keys:
    - `default_provider_id`,
    - `default_model`,
  - uniqueness constraints are scoped:
    - global uniqueness on `key` when `user_id IS NULL`,
    - per-user uniqueness on `(user_id, key)` when `user_id IS NOT NULL`.
- Effective default chain:
  1. user scoped default,
  2. admin/workspace default,
  3. hard fallback (`openai` + `gpt-4.1-nano`).
- Conversation behavior:
  - model selection is sticky per conversation when reopening,
  - new conversation starts from current effective user default.
- Structured generation behavior:
  - `/folder/new` can override model per run without mutating user defaults.
- **5 active providers** with centralized model catalog (labels served from backend):
  - **OpenAI**: GPT-5.4, GPT-4.1, GPT-4.1 Nano.
  - **Gemini**: Gemini 3.1 Pro Preview, Gemini 3.1 Flash Lite Preview.
  - **Anthropic Claude**: Sonnet 4.6, Opus 4.6 — extended thinking (thinking budget_tokens), 1M token context.
  - **Mistral**: Devstral 2, Magistral Medium — Magistral supports reasoning via thinking chunks.
  - **Cohere**: Command A, Command A Reasoning — thinking blocks in `content-delta` stream (field `thinking` vs `text`), `tool-plan-delta` for reasoning with tools.
- Streaming SSE normalization:
  - all providers emit the same normalized SSE event types (`reasoning_delta`, `content_delta`, `tool_call_start`, `tool_call_delta`, `tool_call_result`, `status`, `error`, `done`),
  - provider-specific reasoning formats are normalized to `reasoning_delta` (Claude extended thinking, Mistral/Magistral thinking chunks, Cohere thinking blocks).
- Tool call parity across providers:
  - all 5 providers support tool calls with consistent `tool_call_start`/`tool_call_delta`/`tool_call_result` streaming contract,
  - provider-specific tool call ID formats are normalized at the adapter layer.
- Per-model context budgets:
  - Claude (Sonnet/Opus) and GPT-5.4: 1M tokens,
  - Gemini Pro: 1M tokens,
  - Devstral 2 and Cohere Command A/A R.: 256k tokens,
  - Magistral Medium: 128k tokens,
  - GPT-4.1 / GPT-4.1 Nano and Gemini Flash Lite: default budget.
- Gemini-specific runtime/UI compatibility:
  - UI smooth pseudo-streaming for larger chunk deltas,
  - provider-side schema compatibility compiler before Gemini structured calls (unsupported keywords removed),
  - one-shot structured JSON repair retry using `defaultPrompts.structured_json_repair`.
- OpenAI-family admin-managed source selection (BR-05 delivered):
  - backend keeps `openai` as the only OpenAI-family runtime/provider surface,
  - admin settings own Codex enrollment and the effective runtime source switch,
  - runtime source can be:
    - standard OpenAI key path,
    - connected Codex token path,
  - Codex mode is a transport/source choice on the existing OpenAI runtime path, not a dedicated provider surface.
- Provider-agnostic reasoning system (BR-08):
  - `supportsReasoning(selection)` replaces legacy `isGpt5` guards,
  - reasoning effort evaluation pipeline skips when `supportsReasoning` is false,
  - reasoning params mapped to provider-native format (OpenAI: `reasoningEffort`, Claude: `thinking.budget_tokens`, Mistral/Cohere: no-op).
- Settings save propagation:
  - saving user defaults triggers a browser event to refresh new-conversation defaults immediately (no page reload).
- Display normalization:
  - long model IDs are compacted for badges (example: `gemini-3.1`, `Sonnet 4.6`, `Command A R.`).

## BR-03 TODO/Steering/Workflow baseline — delivered

- Session-bound execution planning is available through the unified `plan` tool contract (`create`, `update_task`, `update_plan`).
- Chat TODO runtime behavior (current BR-03 scope):
  - one active session TODO at a time,
  - TODO progression is persisted task-by-task in session runtime state,
  - completed tasks remain rendered as checked + struck-through in chat panel.
- In-flight steering behavior (chat-bound):
  - steering transport endpoint is `POST /api/v1/chat/messages/:assistantMessageId/steer`,
  - steering is available from the main composer during active assistant generation,
  - steering availability is TODO-agnostic (must not depend on TODO panel visibility/state),
  - steering stays in the same conversation timeline (no side-thread expected behavior).
- Generation runtime migration baseline:
  - use-case generation dispatch is workflow runtime-based (`/api/v1/use-cases/generate` through workflow chain),
  - lineage is tracked through workflow/run/task metadata across matrix → list → detail → executive summary phases.
- Settings migration baseline (BR-03):
  - legacy prompts management UI is removed/de-emphasized in favor of `Agent Configuration` + `Workflow Configuration`.
  - robust operator parity for direct agent prompt editing + authoritative workflow task I/O contract editing is explicitly deferred to BR-15:
    - `spec/SPEC_EVOL_BR15_AGENT_WORKFLOW_CONFIG_ROBUSTNESS.md`

## Admin scoped chat (Chat‑1 + read‑only)

Decision (linked to workspace sharing model):

- Admin **remains the owner** of their sessions (no access to user chat history).
- When admin is **scoped** to a shared user workspace (`shareWithAdmin=true`):
  - chat can **read** workspace data (e.g., `read_usecase`, reference reading),
  - chat must be **read‑only** for writes (e.g., `update_usecase_field` forbidden).

Expected implementation:

- Store scope in `chat_sessions.workspace_id`.
- Server computes a `readOnly` flag based on:
  - user role
  - current workspace scope
  - `shareWithAdmin` of the target workspace

## Streaming OpenAI → DB → NOTIFY → SSE

- [x] Transport: OpenAI streaming call on API/worker (Hono). Each chunk is written to `chat_stream_events` then a `NOTIFY` (minimal payload: `stream_id`, `sequence`, optionally `event_type`) signals new data. SvelteKit UI (static SPA) consumes a global SSE endpoint `GET /api/v1/streams/sse` subscribed to PG NOTIFY; no direct OpenAI → SSE forwarding. WebSocket optional later, SSE by default.
- [x] Stream identifiers: `stream_id` = `message_id` for informal sessions; for structured calls `stream_id` = `folder_<folderId>`, `usecase_<useCaseId>`, `organization_<organizationId>` (deterministic per entity).
- [x] Events stored in `chat_stream_events` (ordered by `sequence` on `stream_id`), `message_id` nullable for structured calls.

Event types (JSON payload, key `type` + `data`):
- `reasoning_delta`: `{ delta: string }` (reasoning tokens)
- `content_delta`: `{ delta: string }` (assistant tokens)
- `tool_call_start`: `{ tool_call_id, name, args }`
- `tool_call_delta`: `{ tool_call_id, delta }`
- `tool_call_result`: `{ tool_call_id, result }`
- `status`: `{ state: 'started' | 'queued' | 'running' | 'succeeded' | 'failed' | 'cancelled', job_id? }`
- `error`: `{ code?, message }`
- `done`: `{}` (end of stream)

Persisted:
- `chat_stream_events`: `stream_id`, `message_id` (nullable), `event_type`, `data`, `sequence`.
- `structured_generation_runs`: `stream_id`, `status`, `job_id`, `prompt_version_id`, `context_type/id`, timestamps.
- PG LISTEN/NOTIFY: used only as a real‑time signal (no storage). The full payload stays in the DB (`chat_stream_events`). If NOTIFY payload exceeds 8k, send only a pointer (`stream_id`, `sequence`) and the SSE re‑loads the event from the DB.

Rules:
- Sequence strictly increasing per `stream_id`.
- `status.started` at stream open, `done` or `error` closes.
- Tool calls: `tool_call_start`, then zero or more `tool_call_delta`, then `tool_call_result`.
- Reasoning/content deltas can alternate; UI aggregates.

## Session history and live update contract — delivered

- Historical session loading uses `GET /api/v1/chat/sessions/:id/history`.
- Response format is `application/x-ndjson`.
- `history` is the canonical frontend session-read contract for reload/open/reopen.
- Live continuation of an active run uses `GET /api/v1/streams/sse` only.
- Frontend chat rendering must not depend on:
  - `GET /api/v1/chat/sessions/:id/stream-events`
  - `GET /api/v1/chat/messages/:id/stream-events`
  - `GET /api/v1/streams/events/:streamId`
- Persisted `chat_stream_events` remain an internal runtime journal used for:
  - runtime recovery,
  - deterministic backend reconstruction,
  - live SSE publication.

Shared BR-05 history rules:
- `history` emits one coherent session thread read model, not raw SQL rows and not raw stream-event batches.
- Host surface (`web`, `chrome`, `vscode`) must not define alternate history contracts.
- Historical reload uses summary-only runtime details; expensive runtime bodies stay out of the initial session-read path.
- Multi-step assistant run projection is reconstructed deterministically from the backend history model and live SSE.

## Chat tracing (debug) — 7 days (20–30 lines)

Goal: debug “agent” issues (tool loops, malformed payloads, context loss) by storing **the exact payload sent to OpenAI** and the tool calls executed.

Activation (env):
- `CHAT_TRACE_ENABLED=true|false`
- `CHAT_TRACE_RETENTION_DAYS=7` (default 7)

Storage (DB):
- Table `chat_generation_traces`:
  - identifiers: `session_id`, `assistant_message_id`, `user_id`, `workspace_id`
  - `phase` (`pass1`/`pass2`), `iteration`, `model`, `tool_choice`
  - `tools` (**full definitions**: description + schema)
  - `openai_messages` / `input` (**exact payload**) + `previous_response_id` when applicable
  - `tool_calls` (args + results)
  - `meta` (callSite, readOnly flags, etc.)

Purge:
- sweep once at startup then every 24h
- delete traces older than `CHAT_TRACE_RETENTION_DAYS`

Useful SQL:

```sql
SELECT phase, iteration, model, tool_choice, created_at
FROM chat_generation_traces
WHERE assistant_message_id = '<messageId>'
ORDER BY created_at ASC;
```

## UI components & streaming (SvelteKit)

- [x] **Key components implemented**:
  - [x] `StreamMessage.svelte`: unified chat/jobs component, shows ongoing reasoning, generated content, and tool call sub‑sections (start/deltas/result)
  - [x] `ChatWidget.svelte`: global floating widget (bubble + panel) with Chat ↔ QueueMonitor switch
  - [x] `ChatPanel.svelte`: sessions + messages + composer
  - [x] `QueueMonitor.svelte`: job list with streaming
  - [x] Session history: loaded from the shared `history` NDJSON contract; active runs continue over SSE
  - [ ] `DiffViewer.svelte`: before/after for objects (coming)
  - [ ] Control bar: model selection, stop/cancel (coming)

- [x] **Simplified architecture**: components integrated in the app instead of a standalone module. `StreamMessage` unifies chat and jobs.

- [x] **Global SSE**: single endpoint `GET /api/v1/streams/sse` with client‑side filtering by `streamId` (instead of per‑stream endpoints).

## Technical architecture (queue + PG LISTEN/Notify)

- [x] **Happy path (informal session)**:
  1. `POST /api/v1/chat/messages` → creates `chat_message` (user), starts OpenAI stream (assistant) via `chat_message` job in queue
  2. Streaming → push `chat_stream_events` (+ NOTIFY); global SSE reads on `stream_id` (client filtering)
  3. Optional tool call → execution, then `context_modification_history` + snapshots in `chat_contexts`
  4. End: `done` + status update (message/stream)

- [x] **Structured calls path (classic generations)**:
  1. Classic generations (use_case_list, use_case_detail, executive_summary, organization_enrich) → queued job
  2. Worker runs OpenAI stream → writes `chat_stream_events` (message_id null) with deterministic `streamId` (`folder_<id>`, `usecase_<id>`, etc.)
  3. Modifications → `context_modification_history` (`session_id` null for classic generations)
  4. NOTIFY → SSE client subscribed to `stream_id` via global endpoint

- [ ] **Cancellation / errors**:
  - [x] `error` event sent, UI propagation
  - [ ] Cancellation via `job_id` (cancel queue + stop stream)

- [x] **Indexes/constraints**:
  - [x] `chat_stream_events(stream_id, sequence)` unique
  - [ ] `structured_generation_runs` (table not created)

## Data model

### Database schema

The chatbot data model enables:
- Manage user chat sessions
- Link sessions to business objects (organizations, folders, usecases, executive_summary)
- Store full message history with reasoning
- Track object modifications via sessions
- Allow session replay
- Stream responses in real time via PostgreSQL LISTEN/NOTIFY

#### Context document tables (to add)
- `context_documents`: id, context_type (organization|folder|usecase), context_id, filename, mime_type, size_bytes, storage_key (S3/MinIO), status (`uploaded|processing|ready|failed`), summary, summary_lang, prompt_id/prompt_version_id for the summary, created_at/updated_at, version.
- `context_document_versions` (optional): file/summary history (document_id, version, summary, storage_key, created_at).
- Traceability: `document_added` / `document_summarized` events in `context_modification_history` (with summary prompt_version_id and summary job_id).

### ERD diagram

- `job_id` (FK → job_queue.id): generation job (structured calls)
- `sequence`: modification order for this object
- `created_at`: creation date

**Indexes:**
- `context_modification_history_context_idx`: on `context_type, context_id`
- `context_modification_history_session_id_idx`: on `session_id`
- `context_modification_history_sequence_idx`: on `context_type, context_id, sequence`

**Usage:**
- Full history of object modifications
- Traceability of changes by session (`session_id` not null) or by structured call (`session_id` null)
- See object evolution over time

**Structured calls vs informal sessions:**
- **Structured calls**: `session_id = null`, `prompt_id` required, `prompt_type` and `prompt_version_id` set, `job_id` set if orchestrated via queue
  - These are existing classic generations (e.g., `/api/v1/use-cases/generate`, `/api/v1/organizations/ai-enrich`)
  - Prompt types: 'organization_info', 'folder_name', 'use_case_list', 'use_case_detail', 'executive_summary'
  - Single calls with a fixed system prompt, tracked directly in `context_modification_history` and `structured_generation_runs`
  - No chat session associated, no messages in `chat_messages` (unless triggered from a session: `message_id` remains nullable)
  - Streaming/reasoning tracked via `chat_stream_events` with specific identification (shared model with informal sessions)
  - Display in object views: expandable tool with specific title (e.g., "Use case list generation")
  - Integration in sessions: via tool if the AI chooses it (not by default)
- **Informal sessions**: `session_id` not null, `prompt_id` optional, `prompt_type` and `prompt_version_id` null
  - Freeform conversations with AI, tracked in `chat_sessions` and `chat_messages`
  - Modifications via tools in the conversation context

#### `prompts` (not created, prompts in `settings.prompts` JSON)
Planned table for managed prompts used by structured AI calls (classic generations).

**Current state**: prompts are stored in `settings.prompts` (JSON). The `prompts` table will normalize and track version history.

**Prompt → object mapping:**
- `organization_info` → modifies `organizations` (`name` + `data.*`: industry, size, products, processes, kpis, challenges, objectives, technologies, references)
- `folder_name` → modifies `folders` (name, description)
- `use_case_list` → creates multiple `use_cases` (name, description in JSONB data)
- `use_case_detail` → modifies `use_cases` (all fields in JSONB data + scoring)
- `executive_summary` → modifies `folders.executive_summary`

#### `prompt_versions` (not created)
Planned table for version history of each prompt for full traceability.

#### `structured_generation_runs` (not created)
Planned table for operational traceability of a structured call (classic generation) and its execution.

**Current state**: classic generations are tracked via `chat_stream_events` with `message_id=null` and deterministic `streamId`. Status is managed via `job_queue`.

### Relations with existing business objects

#### Organizations
- **Relation**: `chat_contexts.context_type='organization'` + `context_id=organizations.id`
- **Possible modifications**: `organizations.name` + profile fields in `organizations.data` (industry, size, products, processes, kpis, challenges, objectives, technologies, references)
- **History**: stored in `context_modification_history` with `context_type='organization'`

#### Folders
- **Relation**: `chat_contexts.context_type='folder'` + `context_id=folders.id`
- **Possible modifications**: name, description, matrix_config, executive_summary
- **History**: stored in `context_modification_history` with `context_type='folder'`
- **Note**: `executive_summary` is stored in `folders.executive_summary` but can be treated as a separate context (`context_type='executive_summary'`)

#### Use Cases
- **Relation**: `chat_contexts.context_type='usecase'` + `context_id=use_cases.id`
- **Possible modifications**: all fields in `use_cases.data` (JSONB): name, description, problem, solution, domain, technologies, valueScores, complexityScores, etc.
- **History**: stored in `context_modification_history` with `context_type='usecase'`
- **Note**: modifications to JSONB `data` fields are tracked with `field` like 'data.name', 'data.valueScores', etc.

### Usage examples

#### Create a session to modify a folder
```typescript
const sessionId = await createChatSession({
  userId: 'user-123',
  contextType: 'folder',
  contextId: 'folder-456',
  title: 'Modify AI Manufacturing folder'
});
```

#### Send a message and stream the response
```typescript
const { messageId, streamPromise } = await sendChatMessage({
  sessionId: 'session-789',
  content: 'Can you improve the description of use case X?',
  model: 'o1-preview',
  promptId: 'use_case_detail'
});

// Listen to streaming events
const eventSource = new EventSource(`/api/v1/chat/stream/${messageId}`);
eventSource.onmessage = (event) => {
  const data = JSON.parse(event.data);
  if (data.type === 'reasoning_delta') {
    console.log('Reasoning:', data.data.delta);
  } else if (data.type === 'content_delta') {
    console.log('Content:', data.data.delta);
  }
};
```

#### Retrieve use case modification history
```typescript
const history = await db
  .select()
  .from(contextModificationHistory)
  .where(
    and(
      eq(contextModificationHistory.contextType, 'usecase'),
      eq(contextModificationHistory.contextId, 'usecase-123')
    )
  )
  .orderBy(contextModificationHistory.sequence);
```

#### Replay a full session
```typescript
const replay = await replayChatSession('session-789');
// Returns all messages with content, reasoning, tool calls, etc.
```

### Prompt integration

**Current state**: prompts are stored in `settings.prompts` (JSON). Tables `prompts` and `prompt_versions` are not created yet.

**Available prompt types (structured calls):**

| `prompt_id` | `prompt_type` | Generated object | Description |
|-------------|---------------|------------------|-------------|
| `organization_info` | `organization_info` | `organizations` | Organization enrichment (`name` + `data.*`: industry, size, products, processes, kpis, challenges, objectives, technologies, references) |
| `folder_name` | `folder_name` | `folders` | Folder name and description generation |
| `use_case_list` | `use_case_list` | `use_cases` (multiple) | Use case list generation (title + description) |
| `use_case_detail` | `use_case_detail` | `use_cases` (detail) | Detailed use case generation with scoring (JSONB data) |
| `executive_summary` | `executive_summary` | `folders.executive_summary` | Full executive summary generation for a folder |

### Data flows

#### Informal sessions (chat)
1. **Session creation** → `chat_sessions` + `chat_contexts`
2. **Message send** → `chat_messages` (user) + streaming → `chat_messages` (assistant) + `chat_stream_events`
3. **Object modification via tool** → `context_modification_history` (with `session_id`) + object update (organizations/folders/use_cases)
4. **Real‑time notification** → PostgreSQL NOTIFY → client via SSE
5. **Replay** → `chat_stream_events` to rebuild the stream
6. **History** → `context_modification_history` to see all object modifications

#### Structured calls (classic generations)
1. **Structured AI call** → OpenAI call with fixed system prompt (e.g., `use_case_detail`, `organization_info`, `folder_name`, `use_case_list`, `executive_summary`)
2. **Prompt used** → reference in `settings.prompts` JSON (tables `prompts`/`prompt_versions` not created)
3. **Streaming** → `chat_stream_events` (with `message_id=null`, `stream_id` = `folder_<folderId>`, `usecase_<useCaseId>`, `organization_<organizationId>` — deterministic per entity)
4. **Run traceability** → via `job_queue` and `chat_stream_events` (table `structured_generation_runs` not created)
5. **Object modification** → `context_modification_history` (with `session_id=null` for classic generations) + object update
6. **Real‑time notification** → PostgreSQL NOTIFY → client via global SSE (same mechanism)
7. **History** → `context_modification_history` for all modifications (structured calls + sessions)

#### Context documents
1. **Upload** → POST `/api/documents` (context_type/id, file) → S3/MinIO storage, `context_documents` record (status=uploaded)
2. **Auto summary** → “document_summary” queue job launched immediately (versioned summary prompt, 0.1k token/page, configurable language, default FR) → update `context_documents` (status=processing→ready/failed, summary, prompt_version_id, job_id) + event `document_summarized`
3. **Consultation** → GET `/api/documents?context_type=&context_id=` + GET `/api/documents/:id` (metadata + summary); no rich viewer (simple download via GET `/api/documents/:id/content` if needed)
4. **Notifications** → AI is notified on upload for acknowledgement; any use‑case processing depending on the doc waits for status ready (summary available)
5. **Traceability** → `context_modification_history` events `document_added` / `document_summarized` with `prompt_version_id` and `job_id`
